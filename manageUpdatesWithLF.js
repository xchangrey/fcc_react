//React: Manage Updates with Lifecycle Methods
//
//componentWillReceiveProps() is call whenever a component is receiving new props. This method receives the new props as an argument, which is usually written as nextProps. You can use this argument and compare with this.props and perform actions before the component updates. For example, you may call setState() locally before the update is processed.
//
//componentDidUpdate() is called immediatly after a component re-renders. NOTE that rendering and mounting are sonsidered different things in the component lifecycle. 
//
//When a page first loads, all components are mounted and this is where methods like componentWillMount() and componentDidMount() are called. After this, as state changes, components re-render themselves. The next challenge covers this in more detail.
//

//Note: You'll need to write the lifecycle methods as normal functions and not as arrow functions to pass the tests (there is also no advantage to writing lifecycle methods as arrow functions).
