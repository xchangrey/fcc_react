//React: Introducing Inline Styles
//
//You apply inline styles to JSX elements similar to how you do it in HTML, but with a few JSX differences. Here's an example of an inline style in HTML:

// <div style="color: yellow; font-size: 16px">Mellow Yellow</div>. In React, inline styles look like this: <div style={{color: "yellow", fontSize: 16}}>Mellow Yellow</div>
//
//You set it equal to a JS object, with the proerty in camelCase.
//
//Note that you can optionally set the font size to be a number, omitting the units "px", or write it as "72px".
//
